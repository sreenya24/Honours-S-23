## 1. Contours
It is a folder containing code I had written using the PlantCV library. It was used to do the post processing of the images such that the contours in each line are clustered together and then hence can be classified as the same group which in our case would be a line. 

## 2. RANSAC
Here, I tried using RANSAC to join the contours and draw lines. This worked somewhat with the drawback being that it created a lot of sublines. 

## 3. Time Analysis
This contains the analysis on time for stages 1 and 2 and the corresponding code for it. 

## 4. PAGE
Using the PhyCV library, this code looks at direction dependent gradient algorithms.
